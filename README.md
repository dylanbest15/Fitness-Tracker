# Fitness-Tracker
This app utilizes an Express server with a MongoDB database to allow the user to create and track daily workouts. It makes multiple API calls using Mongoose to view workouts by date, add workouts, add excercies to workouts, and show weekly stats for workouts. The workout model allows thew workouts to be categorized as either resistance or cardio, and the user may add other information such as weights, reps, sets and duration. This app can function as a simple and accessible workout tracker for the user.
